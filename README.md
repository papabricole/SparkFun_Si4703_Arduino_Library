FORK
========================================
This fork fix the RDS polling and additionally parse the radio text, time and date.
If your radio module does not travel, the entire RDS system is quite useless.
Station names could be stored in a simple text file.
For the radio text, the interrest is quite limited: some station broadcast the
current title of the music played, which is nice, some other advertisement or slogan...
For the time and date, it could be useful if you trust the radio station, which
I personnally don't.
